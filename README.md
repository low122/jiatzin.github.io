## üíª Projects

### Spotify Top 1000 Songs Analysis (Jun 2024)
[Github](https://github.com/low122/Spotify-music-trend)
**Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau 

**Skills**: Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, trend identification.

**Description**: This project analyzes the top 1000 streamed Spotify songs from 2023 to investigate the impact of artist type (solo, duo, or group) on streaming performance. The songs are categorized by streaming counts into ranks (Top 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 650, 817) to identify trends across various metrics such as BPM, danceability, energy, and key.

**Data Processing**:  
- Defining non-overlapping ranking segments for clarity and specificity of my analysis.
- Removing irrelevant variables, dropping rows with missing values, and converting data types, such as
transforming the ‚Äôkey‚Äô variable into a categorical format to enhance the analytic readiness and accuracy
of the dataset.
- Explored and visualized data using Seaborn and Matplotlib for statistical insights.

**Key Findings**:  
- Solo artists outperform duos and groups in total streams within the top ranks.

Top 10 Songs:
 - BPM: Averages 117-125, with a strong focus around 90-110 BPM.
 - Mode: Major mode is dominant (70%).
 - Danceability: High, averaging 69.10%, indicating popularity for danceable songs.
 - Energy: Lower average energy (59.60%) compared to lower ranks.
 - Liveness: Lowest across rankings, indicating fewer live elements.

Top 50 Songs:
 - Danceability: Lower than Top 10, averaging around 61%.
 - Energy: Generally higher and more dynamic than Top 10.
 - Speechiness: Slightly more diverse, with peaks up to 37%.

### 2. **TikTok Video Content Classification (2024, Dec)**
 [Github](https://github.com/low122/Spotify-music-trend)
**Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), TableauÔºå Random Forest model

**Skills**: Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning model development.

**Description**: Developing a random forest model to classify user interaction data into claim or opinion categories. The project analyzes user engagement metrics (views, likes, comments, shares) across videos with different author statuses (banned, active, under review).

**Data Preprocessing**:
- Cleaned and processed raw interaction data using Python libraries (Pandas and Numpy) to handle missing values, normalize engagement metrics, and remove outliers.
- Applied exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Seaborn to visualize trends in engagement.

**Key Results**:
- The model successfully classifies video with an accuracy of ~99%, effectively distinguishing between claims and opnions.
- Claim videos, especially from banned authors, have significantly higher engagement levels compared to opinion videos.
- Videos classified as "claims" tend to generate more comments, likes, and shares, correlating with higher user activity.
- Conducted statistical analysis to compare average video view counts between verified and unverified TikTok accounts through hypothesis testing and t-tests, revealing a significant difference in viewership between the two groups.
- Engagement variables (views, likes, comments, shares) contribute approximately 97% to accurately identifying claim status, thereby prioritizing key metrics for content classification.
- Interestingly, claimed videos have a mean text length of 90 characters, compared to 78 characters for opinion videos.
