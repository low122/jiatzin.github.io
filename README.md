## üíª Projects

### 1. **TikTok Video Content Classification (Dec 2024)**
 [Github](https://github.com/low122/Spotify-music-trend)
 
**Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn), TableauÔºå Random Forest model

**Skills**: Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning model development.

**Description**: Developing a random forest model to classify user interaction data into claim or opinion categories. The project analyzes user engagement metrics (views, likes, comments, shares) across videos with different author statuses (banned, active, under review).

**Data Preprocessing**:
- Cleaned and processed raw interaction data using Python libraries (Pandas and Numpy) to handle missing values, normalize engagement metrics, and remove outliers.
- Applied exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Seaborn to visualize trends in engagement.
- Transform categorical data into dummies variables, which split the categories into different variables with only true and false.
- Tokenize text data using the built-in CountVectorizer in scikit package, which converts the text into a matrix of token counts for efficient analysis by the model.

**Key Results**:
- The model successfully classifies video with an accuracy of ~99%, effectively distinguishing between claims and opnions.
- Claim videos, especially from banned authors, have significantly higher engagement levels compared to opinion videos.
- Videos classified as "claims" tend to generate more comments, likes, and shares, correlating with higher user activity.
- Conducted statistical analysis to compare average video view counts between verified and unverified TikTok accounts through hypothesis testing and t-tests, revealing a significant difference in viewership between the two groups.
- Engagement variables (views, likes, comments, shares) contribute approximately 97% to accurately identifying claim status, thereby prioritizing key metrics for content classification.
- Interestingly, claimed videos have a mean text length of 90 characters, compared to 78 characters for opinion videos.


### 2. **Spotify Top 1000 Songs Analysis (July 2024)**
[Github](https://github.com/low122/Spotify-music-trend)

**Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau 

**Skills**: Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, trend identification.

**Description**: This project analyzes the top 1000 streamed Spotify songs from 2023 to investigate the impact of artist type (solo, duo, or group) on streaming performance. The songs are categorized by streaming counts into ranks (Top 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 650, 817) to identify trends across various metrics such as BPM, danceability, energy, and key.

**Project Highlights**

**Transformative Data Structuring:**

- Rank-Based Categorization: Instead of relying on raw stream counts, I restructured the target variable by categorizing songs into ranks (Top 10, Top 50, etc.). This approach unveiled clearer trends and stronger correlations with key features.

**Key Analytical Insights:**

- Solo Artists Dominate: Solo artists account for 60% of top-ranked songs, significantly outperforming groups, which make up only 12%.
- Danceability is Crucial: Higher-ranked songs exhibit elevated danceability scores (60%-78%), with Top 10 songs averaging around 69% and peaking at 95%.
- Strategic Key & Mode Usage: Although the D# key is rare (~3.67%), combining it with Major mode boosts streams by 48% compared to using D# alone.

**Advanced Visualization Techniques:**
- Violin Plots for Distribution Analysis: Employed violin plots to effectively compare the distribution of numerical features (e.g., BPM, Danceability) across different rank categories, providing deeper insights into feature variations.
